# NetworksResearch

2018-2019 statistics capstone project: try, study, and analyze different routing algorithms by running them in an event-based simulation that models the flow of traffic over large-scale optical networks.

## Fall 2018:
Creation of the event-based simulation.
### Project steps:
- Event Queue
- Traffic Generator
- Network Representation
- Mechanics for trying different routing algorithms

## Spring 2019:
Implementing first fit slot assignment with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
